# Graphs
###### This section covers basic graphs concepts. 

- A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. 
- **Vertex** is a node in a graph
- **Path** - The sequence of vertices to go through from one vertex to another.
- **Path Length** - The number of edges in a path
- **Cycle** - A path where the starting point and endpoint are the same vertex.
- **Negative Weight Cycle** - In a weighted graph, if the sum of the weights of all edges of a cycle is a negative value.
- **Connectivity** - If there exists at least one path between two vertices, these two vertices are connected.
- **Degree of a Vertex** - The term degree applies to unweighted graphs. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting the vertex.
- **In-Degree** - In-Degree is a concept in directed graphs. If the in-degree of a vertex is d, there are d directional edges incident to the vertex.
- **Out-Degree** - Out-Degree is a concept in directed graphs. If the out-degree of a vertex is d, there are d edges incident from the vertex.
- **Edge** - The connection between two vertices are the edges of the graph.
- **Undirected Graphs** - The edges between any two vertices in an undirected graph do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.
- **Directed Graphs** - The edges between any two vertices in a directed graph are directional.
- **Weighted Graphs** - Each edge in a weighted graph has an associated weight, which can be of any metric.
