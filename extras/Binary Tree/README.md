# Binary Trees
###### This section covers basic binary tree concepts. 

- A **tree** is a data structure that represents hierarchical information. 
- Each node has a root node and references to other nodes, which are child nodes. 
- Can also be defined as a **directed acyclic graph** -> ``` N Nodes and N - 1 edges ```
- Each node has at most **2** child nodes

## Tree Traversal
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Visit the root first - then traverse the left subtree, then right. 
- **In-order Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, Visit the root, Traverse the right subtree.
- **Post-order Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, Traverse the right subtree, Visit the root.
- Deletion process of nodes will be post-order.
