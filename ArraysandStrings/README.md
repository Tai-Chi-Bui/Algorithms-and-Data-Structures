# Arrays and Strings
###### This section covers basic arrays and strings concepts. 

- An **array** is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially. These elements, however, can be accessed randomly via index values of the elements in arrays.
- Arrays can have one (linear) or more dimensions
- Index values start from 0
- An array has a fixed capacity, need to specify size during intialization - difficult to initialise
- Use of **dynamic arrays** - arrays with variable size
